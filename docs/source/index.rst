Songs of Syx
============

`Songs of Syx <https://store.steampowered.com/app/1162750/Songs_of_Syx/>`_  is a fantasy city-builder where you start off as an insignificant colony and build, scheme, and fight your way towards a metropolis and empire. The mechanics are complex and true to life, where small events can spiral into the collapse of kingdoms. Easy to learn, but impossible to master. It's set in a low-fantasy world with graphics aimed at stimulating your imagination.

The game is written in `Java <https://www.baeldung.com/get-started-with-java-series>`_ and currently runs with `version 8 <https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/>`_. Mods are also written in Java.
